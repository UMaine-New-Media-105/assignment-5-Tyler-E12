challenge 1 - https://editor.p5js.org/Tyler_E/sketches/mNaylO6n_ - this code creates 5 randomly placed, red jittering bubbles onto a 940x540 canvas.
challenge 2 - https://editor.p5js.org/Tyler_E/sketches/mQ4h_pCW2 - this code is the same as challenge 1's, except the for statement now tells the code
to draw 50 randomly placed bubbles.
challenge 3 - https://editor.p5js.org/Tyler_E/sketches/v3eEvHzoL - this code creates the basis of my simulation, a background of jittering stars, and two
sprites that I made myself, of a tie-fighter and x-wing from Star Wars.
challenge 4 - https://editor.p5js.org/Tyler_E/sketches/Jgh4G2qK6 - The sprites of the ships now move around, and bounce of the edge of the canvas. The breeders have been activated, and you can set a custom value that you'd want to cap the amount of them at, where they stop breeding once they hit that amount. (if this
value is set low, nothing will happen as the catchers won't activate, meaning the breeders just breed at the beginning and thats it.)
challenge 5 - https://editor.p5js.org/Tyler_E/sketches/W5LnI9A7I - the catchers are finally activated, sweeping and catching any x wings (breeders) and deleting them once they touch.
